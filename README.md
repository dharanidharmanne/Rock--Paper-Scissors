1.  Open the `Rock-paper-scisssors.html` file in a web browser.
2.  Click one of the three buttons ("Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors") to make your move.
3.  An alert box will pop up, showing your move, the computer's move, and the result of the game (Win, Lose, or Tie).

#### Technologies Used
* **HTML**: For the page structure and buttons.
* **JavaScript**: For the game's logic, including generating a random computer move and determining the winner.
